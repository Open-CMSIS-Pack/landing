The project is currently hosted and managed as an incubation project by Linaro in partnership with Arm, NXP and STMicroelectronics.</p> <p>Software compatibility for component re-use has long been a challenge in the microcontroller space, especially for the IoT, which is much more diverse at the hardware level compared to PCs or the data center. Open-CMSIS-Pack removes this complexity, delivering a standard for software component packaging and related foundation tools for validation, distribution, integration, management, and maintenance.</p>"},{"location":"#what-are-cmsis-packs","title":"What are CMSIS-Packs?","text":"<p>CMSIS-Pack is a packaging technology that supports more than 11,000 microcontrollers. Packs provide a delivery mechanism for software components, device parameters, and evaluation board support. A software pack (file collection) includes:</p> <ul> <li>Source code, header files, and software libraries</li> <li>Documentation and source code templates</li> <li>Device parameters along with startup code and programming algorithms</li> <li>Example projects</li> </ul> <p>The CMSIS-Pack system solves several problems:</p> <ul> <li>It provides meta-data of files that relate to a software component. All files that belong to a software component can   be identified and information about the original provider is preserved.</li> <li>It enables consistent software component upgrade and identifies incompatible configuration files that may be part of   the user application.</li> <li>Software component providers can specify the interfaces and relationship to other software components.</li> <li>The meta-data of a software component can include dependency information for toolchains, devices, and processors   which simplifies the integration into application programs.</li> </ul> <p>Refer to the Open-CMSIS-Pack specification for more information.</p>"},{"location":"#what-is-the-cmsis-toolbox","title":"What is the CMSIS-Toolbox?","text":"<p>The CMSIS-Toolbox provides command-line tools for project creation and build of embedded applications utilizing CMSIS-Packs.
